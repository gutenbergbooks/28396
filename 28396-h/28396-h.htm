<h3>INTRODUCTION<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>In accordance with classic precedent, this anthology ought to have
consisted of "1,001 Gems of German Thought," I have been content with
half that number, not&mdash;heaven knows!&mdash;for any lack of material, but
simply for lack of time and energy to make the ingathering. After all,
enough is as good as a feast, and I think that the evidence as to the
dominant characteristics of German mentality is tolerably complete as
it stands.</p>

<p>Though I hope it is fairly representative, the collection does not
pretend to be systematic. I have cast no sweeping drag-net, but have
simply dipped almost at random into the wide ocean of German thought.
Some of my most precious "finds" I have come upon by pure chance; and
by pure chance, too, I have no doubt missed many others. Some books
that I should have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>liked to examine have not been accessible to me;
and there must be many of which I have never heard. On the other hand,
the list of books from which my gems have been selected by no means
indicates the extent of my reading&mdash;or skimming. I have gone through
many books and pamphlets which furnished no quotable extracts, but
none that diverged in tone from the rest, or marred the majestic
unison of German self-laudation and contempt for the rest of the
world. I have read of (but not seen) a book by one F.W. F&ouml;rster which
is said to contain a protest against theoretic war-worship, and even a
mild defence of England. How very mild it is we may judge from this
sentence: "England has given us not only men like Lord Grey,
scoundrels and hypocrites, who have this war upon their conscience; it
has also given us the Salvation Army," etc., etc.</p>

<p>One voice the reader may be surprised to miss from the great
chorus&mdash;the voice of William the Second. He is unrepresented&mdash;save in
one passing remark (No. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>136)&mdash;for two reasons. In the first place,
his most striking utterance&mdash;the injunction to his soldiers to emulate
the Huns of Attila&mdash;though almost certainly genuine, is not official,
and could not be quoted without discussion.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In the second place, to
confess the truth, I shrank from the intolerable monotony of reading
his Majesty's speeches&mdash;that endless array of platitudes in full
uniform&mdash;on the chance of discovering one or two quotable gems.</p>

<p>Practically all my quotations are taken from books and pamphlets. The
sole exceptions are a few extracts from pre-war newspapers, cited in
Nippold's "Der deutsche Chauvinismus." It would have been an endless
and unprofitable task to garner up the extravagances of German
newspapers since the outbreak of the war; not to mention that a German
anthologist could probably make a pretty effective retort by going
through the files of the British war press.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>Is my anthology as it stands open to a telling <i>tu quoque</i> by means of
a selection of gems from British books and pamphlets of the type of
those from which I have made my gleanings? Is it a case of the mote
and the beam? I think we may be pretty confident that it is not. I
doubt whether the literature of the world can show a parallel to the
amazing outburst of tribal arrogance, unrestrained and unashamed, of
which these pages contain but a few scattered specimens. In the
extracts from literature "Before the War" (which have always been kept
apart from those which date from "After July, 1914"), the reader may
see this habit of mind growing and gathering strength: the declaration
of war opens the floodgates, and the torrent rushes forth, grandiose,
overwhelming, and, I believe, unique. I know of only one English book
in which the German taste and temper is emulated. It is certainly a
deplorable production; but it is the work of a wholly unknown man,
whereas many of the most incredible utterances in the following pages
proceed from men of world-wide reputation. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Indeed, few contemporary
German names of much distinction are absent from my list.
Wilamowitz-M&ouml;llendorf, Harnack, Wundt, Oncken, Eucken, Haeckel,
Naumann, Rohrbach, Sombart, Liszt, all join with a will in the chorus
of arrogance, ambition, and hate. Many quotations come from a series
of pamphlets called <i>Deutsche Reden in schwerer Zeit</i>, to which all
the most eminent professors of Berlin University have contributed,
with some from other universities. I have also, no doubt, culled
passages from a good many nobodies and busybodies; but when the
nobodies and the somebodies are found to echo and re-echo each other,
the inference is that the general tone of the public mind is very
fairly represented. It will be noted that many of the wildest shrieks
of self-glorification and ferocity proceed from clerics and
theologians.</p>

<p>The world as a whole has been curiously blind to the inordinate
self-valuation characteristic of the German spirit. So long ago as the
beginning of last century, we find Fichte assuring his countrymen
that: "There <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>are no two ways about it: if you founder, the whole of
humanity founders with you, without hope of any possible restoration."
Even Heine, in the preface to "Deutschland" (1844) could write
half-jestingly that "if only the Germans would out-soar the French in
deeds, as they already had in thought," and if they would carry out in
their spiritual and political life some rather vaguely indicated
reforms, "not only Alsace and Lorraine, but all France, all Europe,
the whole world, would become German." "I often dream," he adds, "of
this mission, this universal dominance of Germany." Of course we are
not to write Heine down a Pan-German of the modern, realistic type.
There is more than a dash of irony in this passage&mdash;he obviously
implies that there is very little chance of Germany fulfilling the
conditions that he lays down as indispensable to her world-domination.
Nevertheless, there is a sinister significance in the fact that a
spirit like his should be found dallying for a moment with dreams of
world-supremacy. It was, of course, the war of 1870, with its
resounding triumphs, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>that brought these visions, so to speak, within
the range of practical politics. For fifteen or twenty years, Germany
was, as Bismarck said, "sated"; but with the coming of the youthful,
pushful, self-assertive Kaiser, her aggressive instincts re-awakened
and she fell to brooding over the idea that her incomparable physical
and spiritual energies were cabin'd, cribb'd, confined. The rapid
growth of her population reinforced this idea, and the increase of her
wealth, as was natural, only made her greedy for more. The result was
that she gave her soul over in fatal earnest to an ambitious and
grasping tribalism to which she was, from of old, only too prone. The
Pan-Germans were the Uhlans, the stormy petrels, of the movement; but
the whole mind of the nation was in reality carried away by it, save
for a very small section which was conscious of its dangers and feebly
protested. The egoism of which she was constantly accusing other
nations, ran riot in her own breast, was elevated into a political
virtue, and expressed itself on the spiritual side in a towering
racial <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>vanity. The word "deutsch," always a word of magical
properties, became the synonym of an unapproachable superiority in
every walk of life<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;a superiority that sanctified aggression and
made domination a duty. In many minds, no doubt, these sentiments wore
a decent mask; but the moment war broke out, the mask dropped off,
with the amazing results very imperfectly mirrored in the following
pages.</p>

<p>But self-worship and the craving for aggrandizement are in reality
very uninspiring emotions. The thing that has most deeply impressed me
in my searching of the German war-scriptures is the extraordinary
aridity of spirit that pervades them. A literature more unidea'd (to
use Johnson's word), more devoid of original <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>thought, or grace, or
charm, or atmosphere, it would be hard to conceive. There are, of
course, some inequalities. One or two writers seem (to the foreign
reader) to have a certain dignity of style which is lacking in the
common herd. But in the very best there is little that gives one even
literary pleasure, and nothing that shows any depth of humanity, any
generous feeling, any openness of outlook. Even a happy phrase is so
rare that, when it does occur, one treasures it. I find, for instance,
in a little book by Friedrich Meinecke, a distinction between
"politics of ideas and politics of interests" that is happily put and
worth remembering. Again, Professor v. Harnack re-states the principle
that "he's the best cosmopolite who loves his native country best" in
a rather ingenious way: "There is no such thing as fruit," he says,
"there are only apples, pears, etc. If we want to be good fruit, we
must be a good apple or a good pear." These are small scintillations,
but the toiler through German pamphlet literature is truly grateful
for them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>For the rest, when you have read three or four of these pamphlets, you
have read all. The writers seem to be working a sort of Imperial
German treadmill, stepping dutifully from plank to plank of patriotic
dogma in a pre-arranged rotation. The topics are few and
ever-recurrent&mdash;"dieser uns aufgezwungene Krieg" (this war which has
been forced upon us), the glorious uprising of Germany at its
outbreak, the miracle of mobilization, the Russian knout, French
frivolity, the base betrayal of Germany by envious, hypocritical
England, the immeasurable superiority of German Kultur and Technik,
the saintly virtues of the German soldier, and so on, through the
appointed litany. There is even a set of obligatory quotations which
very few have the strength of mind to resist. By far the most popular
is Geibel's couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Und es mag am deutschen Wesen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Einmal noch die Welt genesen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">(And the world may once more be healed by the German nature, or
character.) It came into vogue before the war. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Kaiser struck the
keynote of the whole chorus of self-exaltation when he said (August
31, 1907): "The German people will be the granite block on which the
good God may build and complete His work of Kultur in the world. Then
will be fulfilled the word of the poet who said that the world will
one day be healed by the German character." In the extracts collected
in Nippold's "Der deutsche Chauvinismus" (a pre-war publication) the
Geibel couplet appears at least four times&mdash;probably oftener. After
the outbreak of the war, it is easier to reckon the utterances in
which it does <i>not</i> occur than those in which it does. Next in
popularity to the "Wesen&mdash;genesen" catchword comes the Kaiser's
brilliant saying, "I no longer know of any parties&mdash;I know only German
brothers." He is no good German who does not quote this with reverent
admiration. Then come four or five others which are about equally in
request: Bismarck's "We Germans fear God, and nothing else in the
world"; "the old <i>furor Teutonicus</i>"; "<i>oderint dum metuant</i>";
Arndt's</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Der Gott der Eisen wachsen liess,<br /></span><span class='pn'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Der wollte keine Knechte&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">(The God who made the iron grow meant none to be a bondman); and,
finally,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Und wenn die Welt voll Teufel w&auml;r',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Es soll uns doch gelingen&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">(And though the world were full of devils, we should succeed in spite
of them.) Even a scholar of the distinction of Ulrich v.
Wilamowitz-M&ouml;llendorf, though he avoids the Geibel tag, ends one of
his orations by quoting "Deutschland &uuml;ber Alles." Imagine Sir Walter
Raleigh or Prof. Gilbert Murray winding up an address with a selection
from "Rule, Britannia"!</p>

<p>One English quotation occurs as often as any, except the ubiquitous
"Wesen-genesen." It is "My country, right or wrong," invariably quoted
in the form, "Right or wrong, my country." This is supposed to be the
shockingly immoral watchword of British patriotism. It matters nothing
to the German pamphleteer <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>that the maxim is American, and that it is
never quoted in England&mdash;nor, I believe, in the country of its
origin&mdash;except in a spirit of irony.</p>

<p>And in the face of this deadly uniformity of sentiments, phraseology,
and quotations, Professor Lasson has the audacity to assure us that
"The German is personally independent. He wants to judge for himself.
It is not so easy for him as for others blindly to follow this or that
catchword!"</p>

<p>We are all, I suppose, unconscious of our own foibles, but I wonder
whether we are all so apt as the Germans to deny them (and very likely
attribute them to other people) while in the very act of exemplifying
them. For example, it is firmly fixed in the German mind that the
English consider themselves God's Chosen People, predestined to the
empire of the world. I have collected numerous instances of this
allegation (Nos. 453-466), but not a single one which is substantiated
by a quotation from an English writer. It is, I am convinced,
impossible to bring evidence for it, unless <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>some expressions to this
effect may be found in the writings of persons who believe that the
English are descended from the lost Ten Tribes&mdash;persons who are about
as representative of the English nation as those who believe that the
earth is flat. The English mind, indeed, is but little inclined to
this primitive form of theism. The German mind, on the other hand, is
curiously addicted to it, and I have brought together a number of
instances (Nos. 117-135) in which German writers make the very claim
to Divine calling and election which they falsely attribute to the
English, and denounce as insanely presumptuous.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> So, too, with
egoism. The Germans do not actually consider themselves free from
egoism; on the contrary, they are rather given to boasting of it (Nos.
212, 213, 248, 300); but while it is a virtue in them, it is a very
repulsive vice in the English. As for cant, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>which is, of course, the
commonest charge against the English, one can only say that, when the
German gives his mind to it, he proves himself an accomplished master
of the art (Nos. 47, 55, 79, 89, 94, 104, 237, 423). Here is an
example, from a book about Germany by a German-Austrian,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which
scarcely comes within the scope of my anthology, but it is too
characteristic to be lost. "<i>If you want</i>," says the writer, in
italics, "<i>thoroughly to understand the German, you must compare the
German sportsman with the hunters of other countries</i>. Then a sacred
thrill (<i>heiliger Schauer</i>) of deep understanding will come over your
heart." For the German sportsman "takes more pleasure in the life that
surrounds him and which he <i>protects</i>, than in the shot which only the
last hot virile craving (<i>Mannesgier</i>) wrings from him, and which he
fires only when he knows that he will <i>kill</i>, <i>painlessly kill</i>. For
this is the root principle of German sportsmanship: 'God grant me one
day such an end as I strive to bestow upon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>the game.' ... And if, by
mischance, the German sportsman wounds without killing a head of game,
he suffers with it, and does not sleep or rest till he has put it out
of its misery." If this be not very nauseous cant, where shall we seek
for it?</p>

<p>Another curious German characteristic is the idea that, however
truculent and menacing a writer's expressions may be, other people do
him and his country a wicked injustice if they take him at his word. A
good instance of this occurs in "Ein starkes Volk&mdash;Ein starkes Heer,"
by Kurd v. Strantz, published in 1914, shortly before the war. This
writer quotes (or rather misquotes) with enthusiasm from Goethe:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Du musst steigen und gewinnen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Du musst siegend triumphieren<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oder deinend unterliegen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amboss oder Hammer sein.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Next he proceeds to quote from Felix Dahn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Seitdem ist's freudig Germanenrecht<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mit dem Hammer Land zu erwerben.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wir sind von des Hammergottes Geschlecht,<br /></span><span class='pn'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Und wollen sein Weltreich erben.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Then, on the same page, only four lines lower down, he remarks
plaintively:&mdash;"Foreign, and especially French, diplomacy is now
industriously spreading the calumny that the German Government and the
German people are given to rattling the sabre, and that we want to use
for aggressive ends the increased armament which has been forced upon
us." Is it mere hostile prejudice to hold that his own poetical
selections give a certain colour to the "calumny"?</p>

<p>Most of the German attacks on England will be found, in the last
analysis, to rest on this quaint habit of mind&mdash;the habit of assuming
that, no matter how hostile and threatening Germany's words and deeds
might be, we had no right to do her the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>injustice of supposing that
she meant anything by them. We ought to have known that she was merely
"dissembling her love."</p>

<p>Some readers may be disposed to regret that the great Germanic
trinity, Nietzsche-Treitschke-Bernhardi, contribute so largely to my
anthology. In the first place, it may be said, we are tired of their
names; in the second place, Germans deny that they have had anything
like the influence we attribute to them. There is a certain validity
in the first of these objections. The constant recurrence of these
three names is certainly a little tedious. They are like a
three-headed Charles I&mdash;or a triplicate Geibel. I would gladly have
omitted them had it been by any means possible. But one might as well
compile an Old Testament anthology and omit Isaiah, Jeremiah, and
Ezekiel. For, whatever the Germans may say, they are the major
prophets of the new-German spirit. Treitschke is the prophet of
tribalism, Nietzsche of ruthlessness, Bernhardi of ambition. It is
absurd to say that they are not influential. Treitschke may have
fallen <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>somewhat out of fashion in the years immediately preceding the
war, but his spirit had permeated the political thought of a whole
generation. To the living influence of Nietzsche there is a host of
witnesses. Gerhart Hauptmann, near the beginning of the war, averred
that the cultured German soldier carried "Zarathustra," along with
"Faust" and the Bible, in his knapsack. Nor was this an idle guess.
Professor Deissmann, of Berlin, tells us that he enquired into the
matter, and learned from book-sellers that the books most in demand
among soldiers were the New Testament, "Faust" and "Zarathustra."
O.A.H. Schmitz, in "Das wirkliche Deutschland," says of the German
youth born in the 'seventies and early 'eighties that Nietzsche was
"the lighthouse toward which their enthusiasm was directed." Prof.
Wilhelm Bousset, of G&ouml;ttingen, writes: "There is among us much unripe,
unclear Nietzsche enthusiasm: many a German ass has thrown the lion's
skin of the great man round his shoulders, and thinks he has thereby
become a philosopher and prophet." Such testimonies could <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>be
multiplied indefinitely. There is no question that Nietzsche has been
by far the greatest single force among the spiritual shapers of
new-Germany. It may be true that he did not intend his "immoralism" to
be read literally as a guide to conduct&mdash;it may be true that, in some
of his most characteristic passages, he knew himself to be talking
reckless and dangerous nonsense (that was his way of "living
dangerously")&mdash;but can we reasonably suppose that soldiers in a
"conquered" country, soldiers full of the belief that any opposition
to Germanism was in itself a crime (see No. 344), paused to look
beneath his surface eulogies of murder and lust for some esoteric
meaning that may possibly underlie them? Can it be a mere coincidence
that, in the first war which Germany has waged since Nietzsche entered
upon his apostolate of ruthlessness, the German armies should have
been animated, to all appearance, by a literal interpretation of his
"beast of prey" ideal?</p>

<p>As for Bernhardi, whom some German writers profess never to have heard
of until <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>we began to talk about him in England, one can only say that
he is an ex-member of the Great General Staff, and is probably a
pretty faithful interpreter of the ideas prevalent in that not
un-influential organization. Moreover, his "Germany and the Next War,"
which appeared in the spring of 1912, ran through five editions at 6
marks before that year was out, and was then republished in a cheap
and somewhat condensed popular edition under the title of "Our
Future." Reviewing this edition, <i>Die Post</i> says that, in its original
form, the book "was received with the most serious attention in
political and especially in military circles," and adds that this
cheaper reprint "<i>must</i> now become a book for the people."</p>

<p>It is an error, however, to suppose that a writer's importance is to
be measured solely by the influence he can be shown to have exerted. A
book or pamphlet may have had little or no active influence, and may
yet be a very illuminating symptom of the national frame of mind.
Every book must be an effect before it can become a cause. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>That
Treitschke, Nietzsche, and Bernhardi have been very efficient causes I
see no reason to doubt; but at any rate they are immensely significant
effects of the psychological conditions of which I am here gathering
up some random evidences.</p>

<p>It was a more difficult question to decide whether the lucubrations of
Herr Houston Stewart Chamberlain came within my scope. Yet I had
little hesitation in including him. The fact that he is by birth an
Englishman does not make him any the less a characteristic and
recognized mouthpiece of the new-German spirit. It may be objected
that he caricatures it, that he is more German than the Germans. That,
in the first place, is impossible; in the second place, while we have
many evidences that Germans, from the Kaiser downward, set a high
value on Herr Chamberlain's writings, we hear little or nothing of any
protest against them as misrepresentations of "Deutschtum." Shall I be
suspected of a quaint perversity of national prejudice if I say that
Herr Chamberlain's war pamphlets are distinctly better reading than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>the great majority of their kind? They are much more individual, much
less stereotyped and monotonous. One finds in them an occasional idea
that is not the common property of every man in the street. It is
generally (not always) a more or less crazy idea, but one hails it as
an oasis in the desert of blusterous commonplace.</p>

<p>The arrangement of my little jewel-heap was more difficult, if less
laborious, than the ingathering. Many of my extracts, perhaps most,
might with equal appropriateness have been ranged under any one of
three or four rubrics. Thus my classification is at best rough and, to
some extent, arbitrary. There is, however, a certain reason in the
sequence of headings. The first section, "Deutschland &uuml;ber Alles,"
represents the "badge of all the tribe"&mdash;the characteristic which lies
at the root of the whole mischief&mdash;Germany's colossal self-glorification,
self-adoration. If there is anything like it in history, it is unknown
to me. Other nations may have been as vain, but, not having the
printing-press so readily at command, they gave their vanity <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>less
exuberant expression. Besides, they may have had a sense of humour. The
manifestations of this foible (if a thing of such tragic consequences
can be called by such a name) fall under certain sub-headings. It was
clear, for instance, that the vauntings of German Kultur must have a
compartment to themselves&mdash;likewise the assertions of a special
relation to God, the claims to the status of a Chosen People, and the
comparisons, direct and indirect, between Germany and Christ. Having
established, by means of a cloud of witnesses, the ruling passion of
the national mind, I present in the following section proofs of the
"Ambitions" in which this megalomania finds its natural utterance. In
the sections, "War-Worship," "Ruthlessness" and "Machiavelism," are
grouped evidences of the methods of force and fraud by which it was
hoped that these ambitions were to be realized. Then, in a final
section, I have assembled evidences of the inevitable corollary to
morbid self-adoration&mdash;the boundless and almost equally unprecedented
contempt and loathing for all adversaries, but especially for England.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>The great majority of my quotations are taken direct from the original
sources, the references being exactly given. I was scrupulous on this
point, not only that the reader might be able to test the accuracy and
fairness<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of my work, but because I hoped that some one, some day,
might be moved to republish the anthology in the original German. One
cannot but think that, when the war-frenzy is over, a brief retrospect
of its extravagances may be salutary for the German spirit. In a
certain number of cases, however, I have not been able to give exact
references, because the originals have not been accessible to me. This
applies to my selections from three previous volumes of selections:
Nippold's "Der Deutsche Chauvinismus," Andler's "Collection de
documents sur le Pangermanisme," and Bang's "Hurrah and Halleluiah."
Andler's excellent and scholarly method has, however, enabled me to
"place" quotations from his collection to within a page or two. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Thus,
if some very Pan-German utterance does not occur on the precise page I
have indicated, it will certainly be found on the preceding or on the
following page.</p>

<p>Italics in my text always represent italics, or, rather, spaced type,
in the original; but Germans are very lavish in their use of spaced
type, and I have not always thought it necessary to reproduce this
peculiarity. Points of exclamation, unless enclosed in square
brackets, are the author's, not mine. I have almost always resisted
the temptation to employ typographical devices to enhance the lustre
of individual gems. In the Index of Authors I have added to many names
a brief note which will enable the reader to estimate the position of
the different writers in the public life of Germany.</p>

<p>In bringing together my material, I have found valuable help in many
quarters. I should like especially to acknowledge my deep obligation
to Mr. Alexander Gray for manifold aid and suggestion.</p>

our own soil has long been insufficient to support us all. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>therefore doubly imperative for us to remain heroes, for who knows
whether the Germanic migrations are destined to remain isolated
phenomena in history! The peoples around us are either overripe fruits
which the next storm may bring to the ground, such as the Turks,
Greeks, Spaniards, Portuguese, and a great part of the Slavs; or they
are, indeed, proud of their race, but senile and artificial in their
Kultur, slow in their increase and boundless in their ambition, like
the French; or, confident in the unassailability of their country,
like the English and the Americans, they have forgotten justice and
made their selfishness the measure of all things. Who knows whether we
Germans are not the rod predestined for the chastening of these
degeneracies, who knows whether we may not again, like our fathers in

<p><b><a name="Gem_159" id="Gem_159"></a>159.</b> Christianity is possessed of potent spiritual energies, since
it inspires our minds, not only with patience, but also with dignified
pride. "Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you, and persecute you,

abandoned the service of God for that of Mammon.&mdash;"War Devotions," by

<p><b><a name="Gem_161" id="Gem_161"></a>161.</b> It is on account of its admirable qualities that Germany has so
many enemies. Friedrich v. Schiller says: "The world loves to blacken
whatever is radiant and shining, and to drag what is exalted in the
dust.... Socrates had to drain the bowl of poison, Columbus was cast
into fetters, Christ was nailed to the
cross,"&mdash;<span class="sc">Feldmarschalleutnant Franz Rieger</span>, quoted by <span class="sc">Kr.

traced back to the saying of Heraclitus, "<i>polemos pat&ecirc;r pant&ocirc;n</i>" [war
is the father of everything].... War is held to be a divine
institution, a law of the universe, present in all nature; not for
nothing do the Indians worship Siva the Destroyer; the warrior is
filled with the enthusiasm of destruction; wars purify the atmosphere
like thunderstorms....<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> We may here refer to H. Leo's phrase as to

wegfegen soll."</i>].&mdash;<span class="sc">J. Burckhardt</span>, W.B., p. 163.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_242" id="Gem_242"></a>242.</b> The Kaiser may have thought that war was not necessary ...
because every year of peace increased the power of the Empire, and
because the German hegemony in Europe was safe enough without shedding
a drop of blood. To this one may reply that the noblest weapon rusts
if its use is too long restricted to reviews and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>parades ... and that
every ascent to a higher mental Kultur impairs the barbaric energy of
warriors, and encumbers them with scruples which damp their joyous
courage.&mdash;<span class="sc">M. Harden</span>, <i>Zukunft</i>, 19th August, 1911.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_244" id="Gem_244"></a>244.</b> Perpetual peace is a dream, and it is not even a beautiful

<p><b><a name="Gem_245" id="Gem_245"></a>245.</b> To appeal from this judgment to Christianity would be sheer

rule by the sword, and, again, that greater love hath no man than to
lay down his life for his friend?&mdash;<span class="sc">H. v. Treitschke</span>, P., Vol.
i., p. 67.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_245a" id="Gem_245a"></a>245a.</b> But it is not worth while to speak further of these matters,
for God above us will see to it that war shall always recur, as a
drastic medicine for ailing humanity.&mdash;<span class="sc">H. v. Treitschke</span>, P.,
Vol. i., p. 69.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_246" id="Gem_246"></a>246.</b> Christian morality is based, indeed, on the law of love. "Love
God above all things, and thy neighbour as thyself." This law can
claim no significance for the relations of one country to another,
since its application to politics would lead to a conflict of
duties.... Christ himself said: "I am not come to send peace on earth,
but a sword." His teaching can never be adduced as an argument against
the universal law of struggle. There never <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>was a religion which was
more combative than Christianity.&mdash;<span class="sc">General v. Bernhardi</span>,

<p><b><a name="Gem_247" id="Gem_247"></a>247.</b> When here on earth a battle is won by German arms and the

will give the command to present arms. That is the Heaven of Young
Germany.&mdash;<i>Weekly Paper for Young Germany</i>, January 25, 1913.</p>

<h3 class="left">War and Ethics.</h3>

<p><b><a name="Gem_248" id="Gem_248"></a>248.</b> Nothing is more immoral than to consider and talk of war as an
immoral thing. "War is the mother of all good things" (Empedocles)....
And there is nothing more moral than the collective egoism, the
self-conserving instinct, of nations.&mdash;<span class="sc">Prof. E. Hasse</span>,
Z.D.V., p. 127.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_248a" id="Gem_248a"></a>248a.</b> The idea of war is the child of <i>healthy egoism</i>, which is
honest to the marrow of its bones, is ashamed of nothing in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>Nature.... but is the basis of all Kultur, of all morality.&mdash;<span class="sc">K.
Wagner</span>, K.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_249" id="Gem_249"></a>249.</b> We must therefore reckon with war as a necessary factor towards
higher development.... A people really learns to know its full
national strength only in war ... only then, indeed, does its full
strength come into existence.&mdash;<span class="sc">J. Burckhardt</span>, W.B., p. 162.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_249a" id="Gem_249a"></a>249a.</b> War makes room for the competent at the expense of the
unsound. War is the source of all good growth. Without war the
development of nations is impossible&mdash;<span class="sc">K. Wagner</span>, K., p. 183.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_250" id="Gem_250"></a>250.</b> The sight of blood and wounds steels the nerves of the soul,
the horrors of war stimulate the spirits, so that instead of the
falsehood and cowardice of enervation, the old heroic virtues are
restored ... fear of God, martial bravery, obedience, up-rightness of
mind, constancy, truth ... manlike courage, manly pity, and all that
is great and good in humanity.&mdash;<span class="sc">E. v. Lasaulx</span>, P.G., p. 86.</p>

completely before the idealism of the main result.... Strength, truth
and honour come to the front and are brought in to play.&mdash;<span class="sc">General
v. Bernhardi</span>, G.N.W., p. 27.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_252" id="Gem_252"></a>252.</b> War is the most august and sacred of human activities.... For
us, too, the great, joyful hour of battle will one day strike.... The
openly expressed longing for war often degenerates into vain boasting
and ludicrous sabre-rattling. But still and deep in the German heart
must the joy in war and the longing for war endure.&mdash;<span class="sc">Otto von
Gottberg</span>, in <i>Weekly Paper for the Youth of Germany</i>, 25th
January, 1913. <span class="sc">Nippold</span>, D.C., p. 1.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_253" id="Gem_253"></a>253.</b> Life as the most necessary medium of Kultur&mdash;that is the ground
on which the modern apostles of peace take their stand.... But our
German morality makes short work of all such rubbish. It says with
Moltke: "Eternal peace is only a dream, <i>and not even a beautiful
dream</i>!" No, certainly not beautiful, for a peace <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>which could no
longer look forward to war as the issue even of the worst
complications would poison and rot away our inmost heart, until we
became loathsome to ourselves.&mdash;<span class="sc">F. Lange</span>, R.D., p. 157
(1893).</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_254" id="Gem_254"></a>254.</b> Whosoever has crossed a great battlefield and has shuddered in
the depths of his soul at all the horrors confronting him, will have
found new strength and exaltation in the thought that here the whole
tragic gravity of military necessity is regnant, and here a
justifiable passion has done its work.&mdash;<span class="sc">General v. Hartmann</span>,
D.R., XIV., p. 84.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_255" id="Gem_255"></a>255.</b> The appeal to arms will be valid until the end of history, and

<p><b><a name="Gem_257" id="Gem_257"></a>257.</b> Unless we choose to shut our eyes to the necessity of
evolution, we must recognize the necessity of war. We must accept war,
which will last as long as development and existence; we must accept
eternal war.&mdash;<span class="sc">K. Wagner</span>, K., p. 153.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_258" id="Gem_258"></a>258.</b> "War is the father of everything," says Heraclitus. It will be

Hasse</span>, Z.D.V., p. 126.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_259" id="Gem_259"></a>259.</b> The efforts directed towards the abolition of war must not only
be termed foolish, but absolutely <i>immoral</i>, and must be <i>stigmatized
as unworthy of the human race</i>.... The weak nation is to have the same
right to live as the powerful and vigorous nation! The whole idea
represents a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>presumptuous encroachment on the natural laws of

<p><b><a name="Gem_260" id="Gem_260"></a>260.</b> It is proved beyond all shadow of doubt that regular war (<i>der

regulative element in the life of mankind which cannot be dispensed

<p><b><a name="Gem_262" id="Gem_262"></a>262.</b> It is nothing but fanaticism to expect very much from humanity
when it has forgotten how to wage war. For the present we know of no
other means whereby the rough energy of the camp, the deep impersonal
hatred, the cold-bloodedness of murder with a good conscience, the
general ardour of the system in the destruction of the enemy ... can
be as forcibly and certainly communicated to enervated nations as is
done by every great war. Kultur can by no means dispense with
passions, vices and malignities.&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr. Nietzsche</span>, H.T.H.,
section 477.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_263" id="Gem_263"></a>263.</b> It is here demonstrated with rare cogency and conclusiveness
that war is not only a factor, but the main factor, in true, genuine
Kultur&mdash;not only its creator but its preserver.... Although the author

means ignores the blessings of peace, as the second factor in true,
genuine Kultur, in a certain measure complementary to war.&mdash;<i>Berliner

argument to the same effect. He says that 41,000 men lost their lives
in 1870-71, and estimates on this basis that, in a repetition of that
war, the Germany of his own time (1906) would lose only one man in
every 1,600 of her population. The confident assumption that the next
war could be nothing but 1870 over again underlies all German
speculation on the subject.</p></div>

<h4 class="sc">(Before the War.)</h4>

<p><b><a name="Gem_326" id="Gem_326"></a>326.</b> War is an act of violence whose object is to constrain the
enemy, to accomplish our will.... Insignificant limitations, hardly
worthy of mention, which it imposes on itself, under the name of the
law of nations, accompany this violence without notably enfeebling
it.&mdash;<span class="sc">General C v. Clausewitz</span>, V.K., Vol. i., p. 4.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_327" id="Gem_327"></a>327.</b> I warn you against pity: from it will one day arise a heavy
cloud for men. Verily, I am weatherwise!&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr. Nietzsche</span>, Z.
<i>Of the Pitiful.</i></p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_328" id="Gem_328"></a>328.</b> The Germans let the primitive Prussian tribes decide whether
they should be put to the sword or thoroughly Germanized. Cruel as
these processes of transformation may be, they are a blessing for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>humanity. It makes for health that the nobler race should absorb the
inferior stock.&mdash;<span class="sc">H. v. Treitschke</span>, P., Vol. i, p. 121.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_329" id="Gem_329"></a>329.</b> Much that is dreadful and inhuman in history, much that one
hardly likes to believe, is mitigated by the reflection that the one
who commands and the one who carries out are different persons&mdash;the
former does not behold the sight, therefore does not experience the
strong impression on the imagination; the latter obeys a superior and
therefore feels no responsibility.&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr. Nietzsche</span>, H.T.H.,
section 101.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_330" id="Gem_330"></a>330.</b> The warrior has need of passion. It must not ... be regarded as
a necessary evil; nor condemned as a regrettable consequence of
physical contact; nor must we seek to restrain it and curb it as a
savage and brutal force.&mdash;<span class="sc">General v. Hartmann</span>, D.R., Vol.
XIII., p. 122.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_331" id="Gem_331"></a>331.</b> One must ... resist all sentimental weakness: life is <i>in its
essence</i> appropriation, injury, the overpowering of whatever is
foreign to us and weaker than ourselves, suppression, hardness, the
forcing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>upon others of our own forms, the incorporation of others,
or, at the very least and mildest, their exploitation.&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr.
Nietzsche</span>, B.G.E., section 259.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_332" id="Gem_332"></a>332.</b> We may depend upon the re-Germanizing of Alsace, but not of
Livonia and Kurland. There no other course is open to us but to keep
the subject race in as uncivilized a condition as possible, and thus
prevent them from becoming a danger to their handful of
conquerors.&mdash;<span class="sc">H. v. Treitschke</span>, P., Vol. i, p. 122.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_333" id="Gem_333"></a>333.</b> A morality of the ruling class [has for] its principle that one
has duties only to one's equals; that one may act towards beings of a
lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to one ...
and in any case "beyond good and evil."&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr. Nietzsche</span>,
B.G.E., section 260.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_334" id="Gem_334"></a>334.</b> The "argument of war" permits every belligerent State to have
recourse to all means which enable it to attain the object of the war;
still, practice has taught the advisability of allowing in one's own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>interest the introduction of a limitation in the use of certain
methods of war, and a total renunciation of the use of others.... If
in the following work the expression "the law of war" is used, it must
be understood that by it is meant only ... a limitation of arbitrary
behaviour which custom and conventionality, human friendliness and a
calculating egoism have erected, but for the observance of which there
exists no express sanction, but only "the fear of reprisals"
decides.&mdash;G.W.B., pp. 52, 53.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_335" id="Gem_335"></a>335.</b> A new type of philosophers and commanders will some time or
other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that has existed
in the way of occult, terrible and benevolent [!] beings might look
pale and dwarfed. The image of such leaders hovers before our eyes....
The conditions which one would have partly to create and partly to
utilize for their genesis [include] a transvaluation of values, under
the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled
and a heart transformed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>to brass, so as to bear the weight of such
responsibility.&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr. Nietzsche</span>, B.G.E., section 203.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_336" id="Gem_336"></a>336.</b> Since the tendency of thought of the last century was dominated
essentially by humanitarian considerations which not infrequently
degenerated into sentimentality and weak emotionalism, there have not
been wanting attempts to influence the development of the usages of
war in a way which was in fundamental contradiction with the nature of
war and its object. Attempts of this kind will also not be wanting in
the future, the more so as these agitations have found a kind of moral
recognition in some provisions of the Geneva Convention and the
Brussels and Hague Conferences.... The danger can only be met by a
thorough study of war itself. By steeping himself in military history
an officer will be able to guard himself against excessive
humanitarian notions, it will teach him that certain severities are
indispensable to war, nay, more, that the only true humanity very
often lies in a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>ruthless application of them.&mdash;G.W.B., pp. 54, 55.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_337" id="Gem_337"></a>337.</b> Those very men who are so strictly kept within bounds by good
manners ... who, in their behaviour to one another, show themselves so
inventive in consideration, self-control, delicacy, loyalty, pride and
friendship&mdash;those very men are to the outside world, to things foreign
and to foreign countries, little better than so many uncaged beasts of
prey. Here they enjoy liberty from all social restraint ... and become
rejoicing monsters, who perhaps go on their way, after a hideous
sequence of murder, conflagration, violation, torture, with as much
gaiety and equanimity as if they had merely taken part in some student
gambols.... Deep in the nature of all these noble races there lurks
unmistakably the beast of prey, the <i>blond beast</i>, lustfully roving in
search of booty and victory.&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr. Nietzsche</span>, G.M., i., II.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_338" id="Gem_338"></a>338.</b> However much it may ruffle human feeling to compel a man to do
harm to his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>own Fatherland, and indirectly to fight his own troops,
none the less no army operating in an enemy's country will altogether
renounce this expedient.&mdash;G.W.B., p. 117.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_339" id="Gem_339"></a>339.</b> A still more severe measure is the compulsion of the
inhabitants to furnish information about their own army, its strategy,
its resources, and its military secrets. The majority of writers of
all nations are unanimous in their condemnation of this measure.
Nevertheless it cannot be entirely dispensed with; doubtless it will
be applied with regret, but the argument of war will frequently make
it necessary.&mdash;G.W.B., p. 118.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_340" id="Gem_340"></a>340.</b> That the lambs should bear a grudge against the great birds of
prey is in no way surprising; but that is no reason why we should
blame the great birds of prey for picking up the lambs.... To demand
of strength that it should <i>not</i> manifest itself as strength, that it
should <i>not</i> be a will for overcoming, for overthrowing, for mastery,
a thirst for enemies, for struggles and triumphs, is as absurd as to
demand of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>weakness that it should manifest itself as
strength.&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr. Nietzsche</span>, G.M., i., 13.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_341" id="Gem_341"></a>341.</b> It is a gratuitous illusion to suppose that modern war does not
demand far more brutality, far more violence, and an action far more
general than was formerly the case.&mdash;<span class="sc">General v. Hartmann</span>,
D.R., Vol. xiv., p. 89.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_342" id="Gem_342"></a>342.</b> The enemy State must not be spared the want and wretchedness of
war; these are particularly useful in shattering its energy and
subduing its will.&mdash;<span class="sc">General v. Hartmann</span>, D.R., Vol. xiii., p.
459.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_343" id="Gem_343"></a>343.</b> We ... believe that [man's] Will to Life had to be intensified
into unconditional Will to Power; we hold that hardness, violence,
slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy, stoicism,
arts of temptation and devilry of all kinds; that everything evil,
terrible, tyrannical, wild-beast-like and serpent-like in man
contributes to the elevation of the species just as much as its
opposite&mdash;and in saying this we do not even say enough.&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr.
Nietzsche</span>, B.G.E., section 44.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span><b><a name="Gem_344" id="Gem_344"></a>344.</b> Even if there were no question of vengeance, even if we were
not demanding reparation for ancient wrongs ... the crime (<i>Frevel</i>)
of opposing the development of Germany is so great that the most
trenchant measures are scarcely a sufficient punishment for
it!&mdash;D.B.B., p. 214.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_345" id="Gem_345"></a>345.</b> Whoever enters upon a war in future, will do well to look only
to his own interests, and pay no heed to any so-called international
law. He will do well to act without consideration and without scruple,
and this holds good in the case of a war with England.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>&mdash;D.B.B., p.
214.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_346" id="Gem_346"></a>346.</b> Hatred, delight in mischief, rapacity and ambition, and
whatever else is called evil, belong to the marvellous economy of the
conservation of the race.&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr. Nietzsche</span>, J.W., section 1.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_347" id="Gem_347"></a>347.</b> Individual persons may be harshly dealt with when an example is
made of them, intended to serve as a warning.... Whenever a national
war breaks out, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>terrorism becomes a necessary military
principle.&mdash;<span class="sc">General v. Hartmann</span>, D.R., Vol. XIII, p. 462.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_348" id="Gem_348"></a>348.</b> Terrorism is seen to be a relatively gentle procedure, useful
to keep in a state of obedience the masses of the people.&mdash;<span class="sc">General
v. Hartmann</span>, D.R., Vol. XIII, p. 462.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_349" id="Gem_349"></a>349.</b> To protect oneself against attack and injuries from the
inhabitants, and to employ ruthlessly the necessary means of defence
and intimidation is obviously not only a right but a duty of the staff
of the army.&mdash;G.W.B., p. 120.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_350" id="Gem_350"></a>350.</b> The more pitiless is the <i>v&aelig; victis</i>, the greater is the
security of the ensuing peace. In the days of old, conquered peoples
were completely annihilated. To-day this is <i>physically</i>
impracticable, but one can imagine conditions which should approach
very closely to total destruction.&mdash;D.B.B., p. 214.</p>

<p><i>Compare Nos. <b><a href="#Gem_196">196</a>, <a href="#Gem_197">197</a>.</b></i></p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_351" id="Gem_351"></a>351.</b> International law is in no way opposed to the exploitation of
the crimes of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>third parties (assassination, incendiarism, robbery and
the like) to the prejudice of the enemy.&mdash;G.W.B., p. 85.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_352" id="Gem_352"></a>352.</b> In reality the evil impulses are just in as high a degree
expedient, indispensable, and conservative of the species as the
good&mdash;only, their function is different.&mdash;<span class="sc">Fr. Nietzsche</span>,
J.W., section 4.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_353" id="Gem_353"></a>353.</b> If the [small] nations in question have nothing Germanic in
them, and are therefore foreign to our Kultur, the question at once
arises: Do they stand in the way of our expansion, or do they not? In
the latter case, let them develop as their nature prescribes; in the
former case, it would be folly to spare them, for they would be like a
wedge in our flesh, which we refrained from extracting only for their
own sake. If we found ourselves forced to break up the historical form
of the nation, in order to separate its racial elements, taking what
belongs to our race<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and rejecting what is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>foreign to it, we ought
not therefore to have any moral scruples or to think ourselves
inhuman. (In this connection I refer the reader to my later chapter on
humanity<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>).&mdash;<span class="sc">J.L. Reimer</span>, E.P.D., p. 130.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_354" id="Gem_354"></a>354.</b> Article 40 of the Declaration of Brussels requires that
requisitions ... shall bear a direct relation to the capacity and
resources of a country, and, indeed, the justification for this
condition would be willingly recognized by every one in theory, but it
will scarcely ever be observed in practice. In cases of necessity, the
needs of an army will alone decide.&mdash;G.W.B., p. 134.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_355" id="Gem_355"></a>355.</b> In spite of his delight in mere success, in spite of his
recklessness in the choice of men and methods, in spite of all the
harshness and brutality which his nature must acquire, the true
statesman displays a disinterestedness which cannot fail to
impress.&mdash;<span class="sc">H. v. Treitschke</span>, P., Vol. i., p. 58.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span><b><a name="Gem_356" id="Gem_356"></a>356.</b> Verily, ye good and just; much in you is laughable, and most of

<p><b><a name="Gem_358" id="Gem_358"></a>358.</b> How much further would Germany have got in Alsace-Lorraine, if
it had modelled its policy on Cromwell's treatment of Ulster, and had

<p><b><a name="Gem_359" id="Gem_359"></a>359.</b> In the midst of this bewildering uproar, the soul again learns
the truth of the old doctrine: it is the whole man that matters, and

<p><b><a name="Gem_378" id="Gem_378"></a>378.</b> Perhaps the greatest danger for us Germans&mdash;greatest because it
does not threaten us from without, but within our own hearts&mdash;is our
magnanimity. O, there is something glorious about this virtue, and we
Germans may be quite particularly proud of possessing it.... But woe
to the people which does not stand as one man behind the statesman
who, by dint of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>hard struggles with his own soul, has fought his way

<p><b><a name="Gem_379" id="Gem_379"></a>379.</b> Through our policy of peace ... we deprive ourselves of the
right of determining the time for bringing about a decision by force
of arms, as Bismarck did in three wars, in which, thanks to his
diplomatic adroitness, he forced upon his adversaries the outward
appearance of declaring war, while in reality Prussia-Germany was the
assailant. Bismarck is quoted in Germany as having discouraged
preventive wars.... But we must not forget that the three great wars
which Bismarck waged were in fact preventive. Even in 1870 the
outbreak of war might have been stayed. It was only the brilliant
manipulation (<i>geniale Fassung</i>) of the Ems telegram that put France
in the wrong and drove her into war, just as Bismarck had
foreseen.&mdash;<span class="sc">K. v. Strantz</span>, E.S.V., p. 38.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_382" id="Gem_382"></a>382.</b> War was in our eyes the most honourable and the holiest means
of awakening the people from its dazed condition. Whether this war
came as an aggressive or as a defensive war was, in principle, a
matter of indifference. That it came to us in the form of a war of
defence was one of those historical strokes of luck which God
vouchsafes to those peoples whom He loves. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>time has not yet come
to enquire whether the leaders of German foreign policy took
deliberate measures to place us in the attitude of defence which the
masses always regard as more moral. It may perhaps be so; but it is
far from impossible that the disinclination for war which placed
certain high dignitaries of the German Empire in constant opposition
to the will of the people may have so far imposed upon our adversaries
as to induce them to attack us.&mdash;<span class="sc">K.A. Kuhn</span>, W.U.W., p. 9.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_383" id="Gem_383"></a>383.</b> Treaties under international law are no more than <i>the
formulated expression of the existent relations of power between
States</i>. If these relations of power have so far changed that the real
or imaginary vital interests of one of the States demand and render
possible the alteration of such treaties, it is the simple duty of the
leader of that State to effect the alteration by all conceivable
means, so long as the risk does not appear greater than the
anticipated advantage.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ein Deutscher</span>, W.K.B.M., p. 7.</p>

<p><b><a name="Gem_492" id="Gem_492"></a>492.</b> Belgium, the granary and armoury, is predestined to be the
battlefield in the struggle for the Meuse and the Rhine. I ask any
general or statesman who has seriously considered the problems of war

war&mdash;that is to say, can be respected as neutral any longer than may
appear expedient to the Power which feels itself possessed of the best
advantage for attack.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ernst Moritz Arndt</span> (1834), quoted in

forced. In such a case ... Israel calls the wars in which it has to
engage, wars of Jehovah. Its God is indeed a man of war, the Lord of

this doctrine directly to the case of Belgium; but he cannot but have
had it in mind. Here is the passage from Deuteronomy: "When thou
drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto
it. And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto
thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein
shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee. And if it will
make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then shalt
thou besiege it. And when the Lord thy God delivereth it into thine
hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword.
But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in
the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto
thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord
thy God hath given thee."</p></div>
